Windows 8-Themed Launchy Skins==============================![Windows 8 Light theme running on Launchy](https://raw.github.com/zachwlewis/launchy-w8/master/examples/windows8-light-blue.png)Usage-----To use the skins, just put the folders located in `/skins` into your Launchy skins directory.Fonts-----This skin uses both Segoe UI and Segoe WP, both of which come with Windows 8; however, these fonts are not distributable. If you'd like to use another font, modify the `style.qss` file in the skin you wish to change and replace the Segoe family with a similar family.Modification------------To modify the skins, use the `Windows 8 Launcher.psd` to customize your launcher. All the standard Windows 8 colors are present in the Photoshop document.Credits-------The settings iconography used can be found at [Modern UI Icons](http://modernuiicons.com/).
